        where:
        
        -  input: python list
        
        This routine can be used, for example, in laboratory settings where data
        is being gathered in real-time and the JS9 display needs to be refreshed
        periodically. The first input argument can be one of the following:
        
        -  a list containing image pixels (for numpy, use tolist() to convert)
        -  a two-dimensional list containing image pixels
        -  a dictionary containing a required image property and any of the
           following optional properties:
        
           -  naxis: number of axes in the image
           -  axis: array of image dimensions for each axis or ...
           -  naxis[n] image dimensions of each axis (naxis1, naxis2, ...)
           -  bitpix: FITS bitpix value
           -  head: object containing header keywords as properties
           -  dmin: data min (optional)
           -  dmax: data max (optional)
        
        When passing an object as input, the required image property that
        contains the image data can be a list or a list of lists containing
        data. It also can contain a base64-encoded string containing a list.
        This latter can be useful when calling JS9.RefreshImage() via HTTP.
        Ordinarily, when refreshing an image, there is no need to specify the
        optional axis, bitpix, or header properties. But note that you actually
        can change these values on the fly, and JS9 will process the new data
        correctly. Also, if you do not pass dmin or dmax, they will be
        calculated by JS9.
        
        Note that you can pass a complete FITS file to this routine. It will 
        be passed to the underlying FITS-handler before being displayed. 
        Thus, processing time is slightly greater than if you pass the image
        data directly.
        
        The main difference between JS9.RefreshImage() and JS9.Load() is
        that the former updates the data into an existing image, while the
        latter adds a completely new image to the display.

        Each loaded image claims a non-trivial amount of memory from a finite
        amount of browser heap space. For example, the default 32-bit version of
        Google Chrome has a memory limit of approximately 500Mb. If you are
        finished viewing an image, closing it tells the browser that the image's
        memory can be freed. In principle, this is can help reduce overall
        memory usage as successive images are loaded and discarded. Note,
        however, that closing an image only provides a hint to the browser,
        since this sort of garbage collection is not directly accessible to
        JavaScript programming.
        
        Some day, all browsers will support full 64-bit addressing and this
        problem will go away ...

        -  imdata: image data object
        
        NB: In Python, you probably want to call JS9.GetFITS() or
        JS9.GetNumpy() to retrieve an image.

        The image data object contains the following information:
        
        -  id: the id of the file that was loaded into JS9
        -  file: the file or URL that was loaded into JS9
        -  fits: the FITS file associated with this image
        -  source: "fits" if a FITS file was downloaded, "fits2png" if a
           representation file was retrieved
        -  imtab: "image" for FITS images and png files, "table" for FITS
           binary tables
        -  width: x dimension of image
        -  height: y dimension of image
        -  bitpix: FITS bits/pixel of each image element (8 for unsigned
           char, 16, 32 for signed integer, -32 or -64 for float)
        -  header: object containing FITS header values
        -  data: buffer containing raw data values
        
        This call can return raw data for subsequent use in local analysis
        tasks. The format of the returned data depends on the exact value of
        dflag. If dflag is the boolean value true, an HTML5 typed array
        is returned, which translates into a dictionary of pixels values in
        Python. While typed arrays are more efficient than ordinary JavaScript
        arrays, this is almost certainly not what you want in Python.

        If dflag is the string "array", a Python list of pixel values is
        returned. Intuitively, this would seem to what is wanted, but ... it
        appears that base64-encoded strings are transferred more quickly
        through the JS9 helper than are binary data.
        
        If dflag is the string "base64", a base64-encoded string is
        returned. Oddly, this seems to be the fastest method of transferring
        data via socket.io to an external process such as Python, and, in 
        fact, is the method used by the pyjs9 numpy and fits routines.
        
        The file value can be a FITS file or a representation PNG file. The
        fits value will be the path of the FITS file associated with this
        image. For a presentation PNG file, the path generally will be relative
        to the JS9 install directory. For a normal FITS file, the path usually
        is an absolute path to the FITS file.
